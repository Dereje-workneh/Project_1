Introduction


Nowadays, Data is the new discovery of oil which important any spect life. data science is one of the new emerging field in which we apply data to solve our real-world problems. Therefore, this work is presenting on (Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and American College Testing (ACT) in the year 2017 and 2018 scores across the United states. The assignmnet was suppose to be the collge Board - the organization that adminsteres the SAT that seeks to improve the participation rates of the exams. This project gives a summary of the two exams in the year 2017 and 2018 across the United states.


My aim here to analyze the SAT and ACT 2017 and 2018:
describing the data performing diffrent methods:
-Data importing and cleaning: during data importing and cleaning erros were found 2017 and coverted to decimal for analysis.

-Explanatory data analysis which includes the standard deviation, mean, lowest and highest score were calculated an identified interms of paricipation scores.
Data visualization: histogram, scatter, boxplot and heatmap ere used to data correlation and undserstanding.
-Discreptive and inferential statistics shows that most of the result close the normal distribution. 

What was my Goal here in Analysing the SAT-ACT of 2017 and 2018

Describing the data
Performing methods of exploratory data analysis, including:
Use Matplotlib to create visualizations
Use NumPy to explore distributions of individual variables and relationships among pairs of variables
Data Munging and cleaning using Jupyter notebook
Starter code

For this project I used a Jupyter notebook. This notebook will use matplotlib for plotting and visualizing the SAT-ACT data. This type of visualization is handy for prototyping and quick data analysis.

Open the starter code instructions in a Jupyter notebook.
-I conclude that to improve the students state departmnet of education play  great role and focusing the colabrations of stackholders as well give attention for college and high school students. Finally, I recommned more research work on the criteria of college admissions in United States collaborated with schools and students families.
